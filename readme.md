# Automatic Nepali Number Plate Recognition System (ANNPR)

ANNPR is a system that detects Nepali number plates from vehicles and then recognizes the number in the number plates. This project was done as a minor project in 6th Semester for Computer Engineering.  

We have used YOLOv4 for number plate detection, also YOLOv4 for character segmentation and CNN for character recognition and then finally integrated all the models with django webapp for user interaction.

This is simply integrating the models and then testing the models trained by us for user inputs.
